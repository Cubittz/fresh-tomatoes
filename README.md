<h2>How to run</h2>
Clone repo to local machine and then open and run entertainment_centre.py from Python IDLE. This will connect to The Movie Database service, so a network conenction is required. After a little while*, a new fresh_tomatoes.html page will be created and opened.

You can then browse films or tv shows, hover over to get additional information and click to run a YouTube trailer.
